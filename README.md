# Pixiv Telegram Bot

1. Accepts a link from pixiv.net and then extracts the images and the name, author, tags.
2. Ask if you need to send the images to a channel.
3. If yes, it will send to the channel and also POST something to [shota-server](https://github.com/yiyang-hsu/shota-server) to store the image. Later, it will be shown in the [latest images](https://boys-love.club/shota/latest/) (NSFW).

Official instance: [Go Shota](https://t.me/stbzs_bot) and its channel [正态分布](https://t.me/normal_distribution) (NSFW).
